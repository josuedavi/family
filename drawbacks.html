          Introduction:
        </h2>
   <p>
     Most people have some form of a family, but what if you didn't? 
     This is a reality for some people. You can have: no siblings, no parents,
     missing a parent, or missing any relatives.
     The effects of not having a family can be detrimental. Another type of serperation is foster care. Not having a family or 
     being seperated from your family should be considered a huge social problem.
     Family is the first social introduction for most of us in the world we all know.

          No Family Present
        </h4>
        
        <p>
          Without family you are alone, left to live and develop from your personal experiences 
          instead of from parental wisdom. Lack of support leads to vulnerabilities and may 
          lead to problems in society.

        Orphanages vs Foster Care, What's the Difference  
        </h4>
        <p>
           It may be hard to believe, but traditional orphanages
          have been replaced in United States by Foster Care Systems.

          Wikipedia defines <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orphanage">Orphanages</a> by: <blockquote>
        "An orphanage is a residential institution devoted to the care of orphansâ€”children 
        whose biological parents are deceased or otherwise unable or unwilling to take care of them."

      <p>
          Wikipedia defines <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foster_care">Foster Care </a>by: <blockquote>
        "Foster care is a system in which a minor has been placed into a ward, group home, or 
      private home of a state-certified caregiver, referred to as a "foster parent" or with a 
      family member approved by the state."

        Conclusion:
      </h2>
      <p>
        Family is very, very, very important! Without one, you are lost. 
        In our everyday lives we should do everything in our power 
        to keep families together. Seperating families and breaking up families should be seen close-to-kin of 
        an illegal crime. Without a family how can a child ever be social?
