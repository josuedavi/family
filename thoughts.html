  <h2>
    What Do I Think?
      </h2>
      <p>Our families are where we experience our biggest triumphs and our deepest vulnerabilities—and they are where we have the greatest
        potential to do good. We believe the family is divine in nature and it is the fundamental building block of society.
        As such, it becomes the foundation for civilization and a sanctuary for the individual. It is where
        we learn the social graces of loyalty, cooperation, and trust. It is where we learn to love ourselves and each other, to bear one another’s
        burdens, to find meaning in our life and to give purpose to others’ lives, and to feel the value of being part of something greater than ourselves.</p>
    <p>I think that if families where strengthened many problems faced by people today would go away. The reason this is because without one we are left vulnerable and without guidance. 
      How else can you learn societal values? Where else will the void of unity be filled?
      Families are important.</p>

     <h3>
       Thoughts On Prison Systems
     </h3>
     <p>Prison systems are a big divider of families. A crime should have repercussions, but is it worth hurting another human for someone else's faults?<b> NO! </b>because one (wo)man 
         has committed a crime another human should not be hurt: emotionally, physically, or subconsciously because of anothers transgressions. 
         People are not aware of the ripple effect their actions have. You think you are doing good by placing someone behind bars but someone is grieving.</p>

        <h3>How Can We Improve/Fix This Problem?</h3>
        <p>The problem: families seperated, silently suffering, no support, alone, disfunctional, and unaware.</p>
        <p>Remedy: avoid prisions, educate yourself on the importance of families, hold each other accountable,
          push each other to raise strong loving families, and lastly support each other through hardships</p>
