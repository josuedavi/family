      My name is <b>Josue Castillo</b>.&nbsp; I am Dominican and Haitian, &nbsp;born in Dominican Republic, &nbsp;Santo Domingo,&nbsp; where I learned to speak Spanish. 
     &nbsp; I came to Philadelphia, &nbsp;PA, &nbsp;when I was 5 years old and quickly learned English. &nbsp;I am a high school senior at George Washington Carver of Engineering
      and Science where I found interest in subject ranging from Anatomy,&nbsp; Computer Science, &nbsp;Mathematics, &nbsp;and Physics. &nbsp;What I enjoy doing the most is coding 
      and creating art. &nbsp;Personally,&nbsp; coding is a form of artwork for me.&nbsp; Other hobbies I enjoy are playing basketball, &nbsp;electronics, &nbsp;and socializing.

      Why I Think Families Are A Social Problem:
    </h4>
    <p style="font-size:18px; ">
      So at Tech It Out we make websites on social problems and on the first day,&nbsp; I was lucky to be late due to trouble with transportation, &nbsp;but I got to 
      see what everyone else already chosen as social problems. &nbsp;I think this was very important because I could see what others thought were big problems. &nbsp;
      I was asked, &nbsp;"Join a group which you like."&nbsp; I enjoy being different! 
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:18px;">I think it is such a big social problem because in my 18 years of being alive I have noticed an obvious disconnect in families-- 
      atleast from what I have seen. &nbsp; From interacting with friends my age there is pain and sorrow where love should be. &nbsp;There is envy, &nbsp;neglect,&nbsp; anger,&nbsp;
      and hurt obvious by just looking into someones eyes. &nbsp;I feel that the root of this problem is families. &nbsp;I feel that with stronger families or communities
    we can become better as people. </p>

      How I Found Out About Tech It Out (<b>Philadelphia</b>)
    </h4>
    <p style="font-size:18px;">
      My school counselor Ms. Olmedo knew that I had interest in coding, and she forwarded an email about the opportunity and I jumped at it.
