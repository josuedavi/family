      Meet The Author:
    </h2>
    <p>
      My name is <b>Josue Castillo</b>. I am Dominican and Haitian, born in Dominican Republic, Santo Domingo, where I learned to speak Spanish. 
      I came to Philadelphia, PA, when I was 5 years old and quickly learned English. I am a high school senior at George Washington Carver of Engineering
      and Science where I found interest in subject ranging from Anatomy, Computer Science, Mathematics, and Physics. What I enjoy doing the most is coding 
      and creating art. Personally, coding is a form of artwork for me. Other hobbies I enjoy are playing basketball, electronics, and socializing.

    <h4>
      Why I Think Families Are A Social Problem:
    </h4>
    <p>
      So at Tech It Out we make websites on social problems and on the first day, I was lucky to be late due to trouble with transportation, but I got to 
      see what everyone else already chosen as social problems. I think this was very important because I could see what others thought were big problems. 
      I was asked, "Join a group which you like." I enjoy being different 
    </p>
    <p>I think it is such a big social problem because in my 18 years of being alive I have noticed an obvious disconnect in families-- 
      atleast from what I have seen. From interacting with friends my age there is pain and sorrow where love should be. There is envy, neglect, anger,
      and hurt obvious by just looking into someones eyes. I feel that the root of this problem is families. I feel that with stronger families or communities
    we can become better as people. </p>
    <h4>
      How I Found Out About Tech It Out (Philadelphia)
    </h4>
    <p>
      My school counselor Ms. Olmedo knew that I had interest in coding, and she forwarded an email about the opportunity and I jumped at it.
